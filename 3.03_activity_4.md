# 3.03 Activity 4

Keep working on the `sakila` database.

#### Query

1. Create a query to show for each rating the average movie length (displayed as `Mean_length`). Sort the results in descending order of `Mean_length`.

2. Create a query to show for each movie the following data (in this order):
    - rating
    - title
    - length
    - mean length by rating displayed as `Mean_length_by_rating`
    - ranking displayed as `Ranking` (showing from the longest to the shortest movie within the same rating).

    This means sorting the results by rating and descending order of movie length.
